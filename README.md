## üõ† Technical Details

### Mock Data Implementation

Due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when deploying to GitHub Pages, the application currently uses **mock data** instead of the OMDB API. This ensures the app works perfectly in production without any external API dependencies.

#### Available Movies

The app includes a curated selection of 10 popular films:

1. **Inception** (2010) - 8.8/10
2. **The Matrix** (1999) - 8.7/10
3. **Parasite** (2019) - 8.6/10
4. **The Dark Knight** (2008) - 9.0/10
5. **The Shawshank Redemption** (1994) - 9.3/10
6. **Pulp Fiction** (1994) - 8.9/10
7. **The Godfather** (1972) - 9.2/10
8. **Fight Club** (1999) - 8.8/10
9. **Forrest Gump** (1994) - 8.8/10
10. **Se7en** (1995) - 8.6/10

#### Search Functionality

You can search by:
- **Movie title** (e.g., "inception", "matrix", "dark")
- **Year** (e.g., "1994", "2010")
- **Partial matches** are supported
